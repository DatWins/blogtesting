I am currently working at Satispay as a software engineer, 
while during my studies I was at Spaziodati for some months.

I studied Computer Science from 2017 to 2022 at the University 
of Trento and Milan, focusing on Algorithms and Data structures, 
Databases, Distributed Systems, and Information Retrieval.
